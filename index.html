        <h2>Vikings? Who? What? When?</h2>
        <p>
            The Viking age was prominent between 789AD - 1066AD and in that time much was covered by the Viking population. 
            Initially from the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, they found themselves influencing the lands of the British Isles, France, Germany and even further afield with evidence of their existence along the Silk Road, Vinland (Greenland) and North America. 
            Considering that many Viking men were but humble farmers in their homeland, it's suggested that due to overpopulation, the demand for land is a potential reason for their expansion into foreign territories. 
            Ultimately the intention of their raids was profit and to improve their wealth and status, doing so by plundering unsuspecting monasteries, for example Lindisfarne, Northumbria in Northern England, which often had many items of fine quality. 
            In Old Norse Viking meant "freeboating voyage, piracy" and thus the first pirates were termed from the Norse word Vikingr (translated as “king of the bays”).

                       The kingdom of the East Anglia bordered the North Sea to the north and the east, with the River Stour dividing it from the East Saxons to the south. 
                       The North Sea provided a busy maritime link to Scandinavia and Northern Germany. The kingdom's western boundary varied from the rivers Ouse, Lark and Kennett to further westwards, as far as the Cam in what is now Cambridgeshire. 
                       At its greatest extent, the kingdom comprised the modern-day counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of eastern Cambridgeshire. 
                       In 865, East Anglia was invaded by the Danish Great Heathen Army, which set up winter camp before departing for Northumbria. The Danes returned in 869 to winter at Thetford, before being attacked by the forces of Edmund of East Anglia, who was defeated and killed at Hægelisdun. 
                       From this point East Anglia effectively ceased to be an independent kingdom. Having defeated the East Anglia, the Danes installed puppet-kings to govern on their behalf, while they continued to campaign against Mercia and Wessex. 
                       In 878 the last active portion of the Great Heathen Army was defeated by Alfred the Great.

                        In 852 Burgred came to the throne, and with Ethelwulf of Wessex subjugated North Wales. In 868 Danish invaders occupied Nottingham. The Danes drove Burgred from his kingdom in 874 and Ceolwulf II took his place. 
                        In 877 the Danes seized the eastern part of Mercia, which became part of the Danelaw. Ceolwulf, the last king of Mercia, left with the western half, reigned until 879.From about 883 until his death in 911 Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, ruled Mercia under the overlordship of Wessex. 
                        After Æthelred's death in 911, his wife Æthelflæd ruled as "Lady of the Mercians", but Alfred's successor as King of the Anglo-Saxons, Edward the Elder, took control of London and Oxford, which Alfred had placed under Æthelred's control.

                        The Viking invasions of the 9th century and the establishment of the Danelaw divided Northumbria. Although primarily recorded in the southern provinces of England, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles (particularly the D and E recensions) provide some information on Northumbria's conflicts with Vikings in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. 
                        According to these chronicles, Viking raids began to affect Northumbria when a band attacked Lindisfarne in 793. After this initial blow,  raids in Northumbria were either sporadic for much of the early 9th century or evidence was lost. 
                        However, in 865 the so-called Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia and began a sustained campaign of conquest. The Great Army fought in Northumbria in 866–867, striking York twice in less than one year. 
                        After the initial attack the Norse left to go north, leaving Kings Ælle and Osberht to recapture the city. The E recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests that Northumbria was particularly vulnerable at this time because the Northumbrians were once again fighting among themselves, deposing Osberht in favor of Ælle. 
                        In the second raid the Vikings killed the Northumbrian kings Ælle and Osberht while recapturing the city.

                        In 802 the fortunes of Wessex were transformed by the accession to the throne of Egbert. In the beginning of his reign he conducted two campaigns against the "West Welsh", first in 813 and then 825. 
                        During the course of these campaigns he conquered the western Britons still in Devon and reduced those beyond the River Tamar, now Cornwall, to the status of a vassal. 
                        In 825-826 he overturned political order in England by defeating King Beornwulf of Mercia and as result seized control of Surrey, Sussex, Kent and Essex from the Mercians, and also assisted East Anglia to break away from Mercia’s control. 
                        Forty Years later, in 865, several of the Danish commanders combined their respective forces into one large army and landed in England. Over the following years, what became known as the Great Heathen Army overwhelmed the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia. 
                        Then in 871, the Great Summer Army arrived from Scandinavia, to reinforce the Great Heathen Army. 
                        The reinforced army invaded Wessex and, although Æthelred and Alfred won some victories and succeeded in preventing the conquest of their kingdom, a number of defeats and heavy losses of men meant Alfred offered Danegeld to pay the Danes to leave Wessex. 
                        This held them off until 876, however their return was short lived and Alfred fought them off seeing the Vikings withdrawal from Wessex a year later. 
                        Some of the Vikings settled in Mercia, and early in 878 took Alfred by surprise with a winter invasion and overran much of Kingdom of Wessex. 
                        Alfred had to initially seek refuge in the marshlands of the Somerset levels, however after a few months he raised an army and defeated the Vikings, which brought about their final withdrawal from Wessex.

        <h2 id="timeline-heading2">793 AD</h2>
        <p id="timeline-para2">Vikings carry out a brutal raid on the monastery of Lindisfarne off the north-east coast of Northumbria. 
            Evidence of this event is documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as follows:
            <br>
             “In this year fierce, foreboding omens came over the land of the Northumbrians, and the wretched people shook; there were excessive whirlwinds, lighting, and fiery dragons were seen flying in the sky. 
             These signs were followed by great famine, and a little after those, that on the same year on 6th ides of January, the ravaging of wretched heathen men destroyed God’s church at Lindisfarne.”

    <div id="timeline-content3">
        <h2 id="timeline-heading3">Circa. 852-856AD</h2>
        <p id="timeline-para3">According to the 13th Century Icelandic Lothbrok Saga, King Ælle sentenced Ragnar Lothbrok to die by throwing him in a snake pit. 
            It is suggested that Ragnar was held in high esteem by his fellow Vikings, an almost demi-god like status. 
            It is claimed by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles he said prior to dying ‘how the little pigs shall grunt when they find out how the old boar died’, foreboding that his sons would seek revenge. 
            Unlike his sons, there is little historical evidence of Ragnar and his time in England, however there are accounts that link him to settling in Ireland and sacking Paris.

            First landing in East Anglia conquering it, then Northumbria and after much of Mercia. 
            Some believe that the army was raised as revenge for King Ælle of Northumbria’s killing of Ragnar Lothbrok, while others suggest that having raided England a number of times the Vikings realised that England was weak and simply seized the opportunity to claim all the land they could.

            Having won their battle Halfdan and Ivar gained revenge for their father making an example of King Ælle disposing him by way of the blood eagle sacrifice. 
            Furthermore, the city was renamed from its Saxon name of Eoforwic to Viking Jorvik. 
            It became the capital of Viking territory in England and at its peak had a population only bested by London within Great Britain.

        <p id="timeline-para9">There was a generation of peace between 959 – 975AD as King Edgar focusses on reforming England through the church, a process sealed by the ‘Regularis Concordia’ in 973AD, prior to his passing 2 years later. 
           Edgar was succeeded by Edward I, who had a brief reign being murdered in 978AD in Corfe, Dorset. 
           His death saw his half -brother Æthelred II reign between 978 – 1016AD. At this time the ‘second Viking age’ was forming in Denmark under Harald Bluetooth (yes his name and runic symbol is now used for the technology found in our mobiles!). 
           During this second age raids happened on a sizeable scale with the objective of blackmail. 
           In 991AD they were given 4,500 kg of silver in exchange to return to their homelands. This kind of payment became known as ‘Danegeld’ (Dane Money). 
           Having taken 22,000kg of Danegeld by 1012, Swein Forkbeard decided to conquer England and in doing so forced Æthelred II into exile.
