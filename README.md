## Design 

### **Colour Scheme** 
The main colour used for the site was teal, this was inspired by the Assassin's Creed Valhalla video game. Text colour was predominantly a charcoal black with the Title being Dark Blue. 

### **Typography** 
Two font styles were used on the site, courtesy of Google Fonts, the most predominant style was Raleway with the fallback of sans-serif and the other style used on headings was Rye with a fallback of cursive.
The developer chose Rye as the heading font to create a sense of history for the user. The Raleway font was chosen for its clean readability and modern look, this to the developer made it a good choice to make the site accesible for users with a visual impairment.

### **Imagery** 
The developer wanted to intergrate some of the common viking imagery on the page. 
The first instance of this is found in the heading where the pictures of viking dragon art are positioned either side of the title. This was done with the intent of making the title look like either a viking helmet with horns or a longboat with the picture acting as the bow and stern.
Next the brand image of the navbar is a viking longboat, this is to reinforce the page theme.
Finally, on the timeline navbar the dates are preceeded by the icon of either a raven(crow) or a dragon. The flying raven was the image on the sails of Ragnar Lothbrok's clan, and the dragon represents JÃ¶rmungandr, the midgard serpent, and symbolised chaos and destruction.

> ## Testing 
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### **W3C Markup Validator**

![Markup Validator Report](/assets/images/rm/"Markup Validator")

### **W3C CSS Validator**  

![CSS Validator Report](/assets/images/rm/ "CSS Validator")
	The result of the CSS validator highlighted 17 errors, these errors are associated with Bootstrap's CDN, which the developer hasn't access to change.

> ## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

##  *First Time Visitor Goals*  
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the page and learn more about the Vikings. 

Upon arriving at the page the title immediately gives the user an overview of the page content.
![Title](/assets/images/rm/title.png "Title")
The options on the menu given further depth into what can be expected from the content.
![Navbar](/assets/images/rm/navbar.png "Navbar")
The user can then find informaion about the vikings throughout the page starting with the summary paragraph, through to the timeline
![Top of Page](/assets/images/rm/top-of-page.png "Top of Page")

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the page to find content. 

The user can easily navigate through the page wherever they are on the page. 
At the top of the page the user has the option to jump to the relevant section.
![Navbar](/assets/images/rm/navbar.png "Navbar")
Once in the the page content the user can get back to the top of the page in one click by using the back to top link
![Back to top](/assets/images/rm/back-to-top.png "Back to Top")

- As a First Time Visitor, I want the page visually appealing.

The user is greeted by vibrant colours when arriving on the page, which creates a welcoming atmosphere.
Rye and Raleway fonts add to this by creating a modern look that is aligned with the page theme.
![Top of Page](/assets/images/rm/top-of-page.png "Top of Page")

### *Student Goals* 

- As a Student, I want to find information about the vikings that aids my understanding. 

This is achieved in multiple ways on the page.
Firstly Google Maps has been coded to render each modern county but the differs to show the English Territory to which it formerly belonged.
this creates a visual understanding of how England was divided. 
![Google Maps](/assets/images/rm/google-maps.png "Google Maps")

To further aid Goolge Maps the accordion feature in position next to it, dispalying the same flags but with the addition of the territory names, by doing this it is acting as a key for the map.
![Maps and Accordion](/assets/images/rm/map-and-accordion.png "Maps and Accordion")

The accordion also provides additonal information about the history or each area adding an extra layer of understanding.

Further down the page the timeline acts as another visual experience. 
![Timeline](/assets/images/rm/timeline.png "Timeline")

- As a Student, I want interaction to make learning fun and accesible. 

The use of interactive elements, such as Google Maps, Accordion and Timeline promotes engaging and fun material which makes the learning more accesible
![Maps and Accordion](/assets/images/rm/map-and-accordion.png "Maps and Accordion")
![Timeline](/assets/images/rm/timeline.png "Timeline")

- As a Student, I want imagery to assist with the written theory.

By displaying images for each written section on the timeline, the developer has ensure that differing learning styles are met.
![Timeline text and images](/assets/images/rm/text-and-image.png "Timeline text and images")

### *History Enthusiast Goals* 

- As a History Enthusiast, I want to explore the areas of England. 

On Google Maps it is possible to zoom the map in and out with the flags displayed, this allows for the user to explore where their location was previously in history.
There is also the option to see the county name by hovering of the left of the flags.
![Maps Hover](/assets/images/rm/hover-flag.png "Maps Hover")

On the accordion, the four territories each have their own section with an explanation of their history.
![East Anglia](/assets/images/rm/accor-east.png "East Anglia")

- As a History Enthusiast, I want to understand the underlying situations in England. 
This can be located by the user by exploring the territories of England. Each section details how these areas where formed. 
East Anglia is seen above. 
![Mercia](/assets/images/rm/accor-merc.png "Mercia")
![Northumbria](/assets/images/rm/accor-north.png "Northumbria")
![Wessex](/assets/images/rm/accor-wess.png "Wessex")

- As a History Enthusiast, I want to clarify the order of events during the vikings time in England.

The timeline feature clearly shows events in chronological order.
![Timeline](/assets/images/rm/timeline.png "Timeline")

Where more than major event happen in a period of time the earliest year was set first followed by the next chronological.
This is the case between 865-874 A.D where with in this time period two major events occured in 866A.D., the developer therefore
decided that it was best to label them i and ii to acknowledge that there were seperate events.
![Timeline Section](/assets/images/rm/timeline-section.png "Timeline Section")

## **Further Testing** 
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers. 
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad Air & iPhoneX. Other devices were tested through the inspect web developer tools.

##  **Known Bugs** 
On the viking boat animation below the timeline, there a few points were the boat appears to move back before animating. 
This is due to the margin-left value being a differential of 6 e.g.(item 1 8%, item 2 14%) and the animation function taking each point and taking 7 away.
Visually this means that points that are a value or greater apart appear as though the ship is moving from the previous timeline item,
whereas those that are less, move back before continuing the animation. 
This was a contigency plan as the planned animation was to take the current value of margin left on the image as the start point and then move to the new location, however when
implementing this the first value always return "null" on the console and despite many efforts in getting this to work the developer was unable to find a solution within their current ability.

> ### Limitations:
The largest screen size accessible to the developer was 1366px-width, therefore larger screen sizes may display different to intented layout.

> ### Future Additions:
1. There is scope for this site to add additonal pages, for example the site can focus on other countries influenced by the vikings such as France and Ireland, or alternatively the site can focus on the culture and battle tactics of the vikings.
