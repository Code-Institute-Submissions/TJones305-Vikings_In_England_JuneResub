## Design 

### **Colour Scheme** 
The main colour used for the site was teal, this was inspired by Assasin's Creed Valhalla video game. Text colour was predominantly a charcoal black with the Title being Dark Blue. 

### **Typography** 
Two font styles were used on the site, courtesy of Google Fonts, the most predominant style was Raleway with the fallback of sans-serif and the other style used on headings was Rye with a fallback of cursive.
The developer chose Rye as the heading font to create a sense of history for the user. The Raleway font was chosen for its clean readability and modern look, this to the developer made it a good choice to make the site accesible for users with a visual impairment.

### **Imagery** 
The developer wanted to intergrate some of the common viking imagery on the page. 
The first instance of this is found in the heading where the pictures of viking dragon art are positioned either side of the title. This was done with the intent of making the title look like either a viking helmet with horns or a longboat with the picture acting as the bow and stern.
Next the brand image of the navbar is a viking longboat, this is to reinforce the page theme.
Finally, on the timeline navbar the dates are preceeded by the icon of either a raven(crow) or a dragon. The flying raven was the image on the sails of Ragnar Lothbrok's clan, and the dragon represents JÃ¶rmungandr, the midgard serpent, and symbolised chaos and destruction.
